.
For 2 months now, I&#39;ve been working at the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute @ngi_onsafeground as a -wait for it- geotechnical engineer ü•≥ 
.
While there are plenty of digital tools for the modern day engineer, every now and then some hand calculations are needed. Not gonna lie: love that ü§©

. 
My partner is an opera singer, and together with a group of other freelance musicians, they&#39;ve created Trondheim Kammeropera. They aim to produce opera in the Trondheim area while employing local artists.
. 
I helped with their rebranding by designing their new logo and building their new website! It was so fun! (And at times frustrating, looking at you IOS not liking my fancy CSS.)
. 
I created the site with Hugo and bootstrap. It&#39;s hosted on Netlify CDN. Netlify CMS is used for content editing, to leave me out of the equation in future üòÑ
. 
And it works so well! The Netlify CMS interface is easy to use and tweak, and works for our purposes. . (The sharp-eyed will find some details that need fixing. They might be when I learn more in future.)

            <img class="carousel_album" src="https://profilepageimages.usecue.com/images/turningcoffeeintocode/small/2.jpg" alt="I upgraded my hard drive tonight!
. 
My trusty old Lenovo Thinkpad Edge S430 from 2012 suddenly failed to boot. The error message displayed was &#34;kernel panic&#34; üò¨
. 
I booted with a Linux Live bootable USB to backup stuff before replacing the hard drive.
. 
My laptop is so old it had a standard hard disk drive, that is, those who rotate a disc to retrieve data. The new hard drive is a Solid State Drive (SSD), which behaves as the name implies. It&#39;s also supposed to be faster.
. 
I got 240GB one, so it wasn&#39;t that expensive (~60‚Ç¨).
. 
1. To swap hard drives, you need a PH00x50mm screwdriver and a new hard drive. . 
2. Remove the hard drive lid after researching online how to, regarding your specific computer, and pull out the old drive. Remove the side screws of the tray-ish thing the drive is attached to.
. 
3. Place your new drive in the tray, fasten the side screws, pay attention to which side of drive should be face up (yes, I erred), and tuck it in. Fasten the lid screw.
. 
THAT&#39;S IT!
. 
Though, your new drive is completely empty, so depending on which OS you want, the backup process may or may not be more tedious. I chose to do a clean install of my favourite Linux distro, which greatly simplifies things.
. 
Also, I&#39;m leaving the old drive hanging around. I plan to buy an adapter so I can use it as an external hard drive.

. 
Then what. Replace the phone? It was bought for 2 000 NOK (~200‚Ç¨) on autumn of 2016, so it was 3.5 years old after all. But it did work, albeit a tad bit slow, and I hate throwing away stuff that works.
. 
Have it fixed? That would cost 3/4 of what my phone costed and what a similar new phone would cost, so it felt like a waste of time and money.
. 
But. What if. What if I fix it myself? Okay, it was still not a cheap option, approx 1 000 NOK for ordering spare parts and tools for the job. Also, this option would have the risk of me ruining the phone.
. 
I tried to fix it myself üí™ And I succeeded! Ifixit has nice tutorials for many many gadgets, and I followed one for mine. One thing though: I broke the cable of the right touch button (Samsung phone) üò≠üò≠üò≠
. 
In the time between breaking and fixing the phone, I used my trusted Sony Ericsson K530i, which I used from 2008 till 2016. That was efficiently a &#34;digital detox&#34;, and I think I&#39;ll continue being more disconnected.">

Advent of Code, of course. I got my IntCode* Virtual Machine up and running, so every other challenge is relatively simple.
. *IntCode is a programming language invented for the purpose of the challenges. It resembles assembly. On days 2, 5, 7 and 9, we gradually added bits and pieces to our IntCode VM so that we can run IntCode üòÖ
. 
Seems a lot of people hate that IntCode thing, especially on the subreddit, but I like it!
. 
So, I only did Haskell for the first day, and that was all I could do üòÖ I&#39;ll see to it, eventually, if I ever get up to speed. Which I won&#39;t. Day 18 is killing me, and according to the stats (swipe‚û°Ô∏è) it would seem that I&#39;m not the only one üòÖ

. 
I&#39;ve always wanted to learn a functional programming language, so I figured I would try solving some of the tasks with Haskell.
. 
I don&#39;t know Haskell üò¨ But I&#39;ve read 2 or 3 sections of Learn you a Haskell for great good, and that was sort of enough for today&#39;s task.
. 
I see that my favourite aspects of python, like list comprehensions, are a part of Haskell too! (I think Haskell was the influencer üòÖ)
. 
My favourite aspect of Haskell so far is the pattern matching of functions üòç Creating the recursive function was a breeze. It works like a switch statement.
. 
My python solutions and the occasional Haskell solution are found at my github hildenost/advent-of-code-2019

. 
Advent of Code is an advent calendar with a new task every day until Christmas Day. It&#39;s just about the right amount of challenging to be both fun, intriguing and doable üòä You can compete with any language.
. 
My language of choice is python, but lately I&#39;ve become very curious to especially functional programming languages. I read &#34;Learn you a Haskell for great good&#34; at the moment, and it seems possible to do some of this years tasks in Haskell.
. 
So, here I am, just chilling in a very natural pose in the recliner in front of the fireplace whilst drinking coffee and showing off some unfinished code. It&#39;s Day 15 to be exact, and I struggle with creating the correct movement for the Elfs and the Goblins. Because obviously. . .

They kindly asked for me to share the resources, so I overdid it by creating a kind of course module on the web site that recaps each lesson.

Again, love Hugo and Bootstrap! It&#39;s so easy to set things up and focus on content.
