Aurum has a varied repertoire that ranges from traditional, classical choral music to experimental contemporary and popular music, and they have had several performances with some of Norway’s leading pop artists. The choirs' projects often arise from curiosity towards new musical expressions that explore and challenge the borders of classical chamber music.
