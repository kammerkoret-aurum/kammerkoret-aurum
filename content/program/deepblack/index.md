There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,\
And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;\
\
And frogs in the pools singing at night,\
And wild plum-trees in tremulous white;\
\
Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;\
\
And not one will know of the war, not one\
Will care at last when it is done.\
\
Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree\
If mankind perished utterly;\
\
And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,\
Would scarcely know that we were gone.
