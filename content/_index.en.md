title: "Kammerkoret Aurum"
---

Kammerkoret Aurum is an ambitious and busy chamberchoir from Trondheim, Norway.
The choir was founded in 2006 and consists of roughly 30 singers. 
Today, Eva Holm Foosnæs is the conductor of the choir.
The choir wants to have a high musical level and regularly orders newly composed works for choir.

In 2022 we released our second album **Alt hva mødrene har kjempet** _(All that our mothers have fought)_, which has received critical acclaim both in Norway and outside of Norway.
