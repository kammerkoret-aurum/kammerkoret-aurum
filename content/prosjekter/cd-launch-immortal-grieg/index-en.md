A﻿bout the project:
T﻿he Grieg project started in 2021. The goal with the project has been to make Edvard Griegs romances available by arranging them for a capella choir, as well as putting our own touch on the pieces. Griegs romances are a true national treasure and many of them are well known, also outside the nations borders. The challenge is that the romances are not written for choir, but for a pianist and a singer. Norway is a proud choir nation, and as a part of that we wanted to explore the potential in Griegs melodies by giving them new life as choir music, and present it to people in Norway and abroad.
E﻿va Holm Foosnæs has arranged and composed a total of 10 pieces to Immortal Grieg. The pieces have a varying difficulty level, there is something for every choir.
T﻿he project was first presented at our traditional 17th of May concert at Ringve Musikkmuseum in 2022. The same spring, we went on a tour by Hurtigruten to Ålesund and Hjørundfjorden. As Grieg is a famous composer outside the Norwegian borders too, we decided to bring the project abroad. In the fall of 2022, we travelled to Berlin, Köln and Strasbourg and held concerts with fantastic local choirs. 
T﻿his May, we were finally able to record the Grieg project in collaboration with Jørgen Meyer in meau AS and Audun Kvitland Røstad, and with a beautiful cover by Susann Klubben, we are finally ready to present Immortal Grieg to our audience!

W﻿elcome!
