Kammerkoret Aurum once again welcomes you to one of our unique concerts in the dark. This time with a focus on outer space.

When the sense of sight is allowed to rest, the other senses come more to life. We want to play with new soundscapes, both spatially and visually. Parts of the concert will take place in complete darkness. We will also explore the traditional concert with light choreography and other mysterious surprises. On the team we have  Trond Walleraunet on lights and Are Åberg on sound design, who tie everything together in a great light and sound landscape. The repertoire is a mixture of Norwegian and European contemporary music, and ranges from several composers such as Evija Skuke, Michael Ostrzyga, Ståle Kleiberg, Elisabeth Anvik, Phillip Glass and others.

We have two concerts in Øysteinsalen in Trondheim: at 18:00 and at 20:30.

We are also having a concert in Steinkjer Kulturhus at 18:00, click here: <https://fb.me/e/75SZgukEz> 

Ticket price: Adults NOK 300, children/students NOK 200
T﻿ickets: https://kammerkoretaurum.hoopla.no/

The tickets are released on Friday 26 January at 16:00!
