Together with Musikkforeningen Nidarholm, we are happy to invite you to a wonderful concert in Nidarosdomen 19th November.

JUPITER in Nidarosdomen includes a premiere of the work Jupiter Moons by Eva Holm Foosnæs. The work is inspired by sounds from outer space, and offers exciting and faceted colours and transparent sounds. The work is funded by Det norske komponistfond.

In addition, cathedral cantor Petra Bjørkhaug will join us.

Welcome!
