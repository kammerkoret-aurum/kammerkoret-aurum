W﻿elcome to our last concert in 2023: FANDANGO!
W﻿e are soon putting a very busy fall behind us. In October we won the National Championship in Choir here in Trondheim. After that we went on a tour in the Basque Contry in Northern Spain to participate in the international Choral Competition in Tolosa.
W﻿e had a fantastic experience, both singing in the competition and at several concerts in small towns in the area. Now we are bringing the repertoire to Trondheim and Vår Frue kirke. We hope that you will come and spend an hour of your time with us!
T﻿he concert spans a wide range of choral music, from Norwegian traditional music to som e Basque pieces, from church music to new Nordic compositions. We are sure you will hear something you enjoy!

P﻿lace: Vår Frue kirke, Trondheim
P﻿rice: Adults 250 NOK, students/kids 150 NOK
