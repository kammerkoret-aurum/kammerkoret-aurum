T﻿ogether with Musikkforeningen Nidarholm, we are looking forward to inviting you to a concert in majestic Nidarosdomen. 

J﻿UPITER in Nidarosdomen will amongst others include an original performance by Musikkforeningen Nidarholm of the piece Jupiter Moons by Eva Holm Foosnæs. The piece is inspired by sounds from space. We are very much looking forward to presenting this piece that will be conducted by Eva herself. 
T﻿he piece is supported by Det Norske komponistfond. 

T﻿ogether with us we also have Petra Bjørkhaug, organist at Nidarosdomen.
