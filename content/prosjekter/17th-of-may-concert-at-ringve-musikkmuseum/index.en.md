W﻿elcome to our traditional concert on the Norwegian Constitution Day! 
I﻿n collaboration with Ringve Musikkmuseum, our concert has become a must for many. I﻿n the beautiful surroundings at Ringve, you will hear several traditional pieces, with Edvard Grieg's music in the center. 

K﻿ammerkoret Aurum is a mixed choir based in Trondheim with around 30 singers. The choir has a high activity level throughout the year with concerts and tours, and was in 2023 awarded the title of Norwegian Choir Champions. 

K﻿ammerkoret Aurum is conducted by Eva Holm Foosnæs. She has arranged many of the pieced that will be performed at the concert. These pieces will also be recorded later in May, making this concert an exclusive sneak-peek of the upcoming CD.
