Kammerkoret Aurum welcomes new chorists twice a year.

W﻿e seek to hold a high musical level and we have a varied and challenging repertoir consisting of both new and old music. We have choir practice every Wednesday from 7pm - 10pm in Berg kirke, Trondheim, with some additional intensive practice weekends during a year. The choir is governed by the choristers.

P﻿lease send us an email at [post@kammerkoret-aurum.no](mailto:post@kammerkoret-aurum.no)if you want to audition or have any questions about being a chorister in Kammerkoret Aurum.
